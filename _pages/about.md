I am a student at Konkuk University, majoring in both Civil & Environmental Engineering and Computer Engineering. 

During my undergraduate years, I conducted research in a Smart City Lab and gained experience as a computer vision researcher at a startup. Currently, I am delving into machine learning research focused on Construction Management, geotechnical prediction. 

My academic and professional interests lie in Construction data and Production data.
