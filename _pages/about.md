I am currently working as an Assistant Researcher at Seoul National University.

During my undergraduate studies at Konkuk University, I double-majored in Civil & Environmental Engineering and Computer Engineering, gained research experience in a smart city lab, and worked as a Computer Vision Researcher at an AI startup.

Building on these experiences, my current research explores machine learning for geotechnical prediction and the application of AI in construction, and I am particularly interested in leveraging construction data.
