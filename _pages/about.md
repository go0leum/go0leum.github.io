I am pursuing a double major in Civil & Environmental Engineering and Computer Engineering at Konkuk University. 

As an undergraduate, I gained research experience in a smart city lab and later worked as a computer vision researcher at an AI startup. 

My current research explores machine learning for geotechnical prediction and the application of AI in construction. I am particularly interested in leveraging GIS, construction data, and disaster safety data in this work.
