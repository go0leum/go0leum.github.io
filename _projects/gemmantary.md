## üèÖ Project Overview

**Gemmentary** is an AI-powered system designed to **automatically generate real-time sports commentary** based on Olympic video footage. By combining recent advances in **video-language models**, **prompt engineering**, and **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, our system provides compelling and context-aware commentaries tailored to specific events and athletes.

This project explores the intersection of **multimodal understanding** and **creative generation**, demonstrating how AI can augment the way we experience sports broadcasts.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Pipeline

Our pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **User Input**  
   The user provides:
   - A video clip of the event
   - Sport type (e.g., diving, gymnastics)
   - Athlete‚Äôs name
   - Event details (e.g., Paris Olympics, final round)

2. **Structured Formatting**  
   The input metadata is embedded into a **custom prompt format** that contextualizes the scene for the model.

3. **Video Description (Captioning)**  
   We utilize **Video-LLaVA**, a vision-language model, to generate a rich textual description of the video content, including motion, emotion, and physical dynamics.

4. **Commentary Generation**  
   Through **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, we combine the formatted metadata and video caption, and feed them into the **Gemma LLM**, which generates broadcast-style commentary with a natural narrative flow.

**Prompt**  
> *Generate a sports commentary script for the men's 10m platform diving final featuring Chao Yuan at the Paris Olympics, using the video caption as context.*

**Generated Commentary Output**  
> *Good evening, sports fans, and welcome to the final of the men's 10m platform diving at the Paris Olympics. We have a battle for gold between two of the greatest divers of all time‚ÄîChao Yuan from China and the defending champion from [another country].*

> *The dive: The athletes take their positions on the platform. The crowd rises as the music starts. Chao Yuan launches into the air with grace and precision. He executes a flawless somersault dive, showcasing world-class control and athleticism.*

> *The aftermath: Chao Yuan hits the water with an impressive splash, creating a moment of pure exhilaration. The judges are visibly impressed, and the crowd erupts into applause.*

> *Conclusion: With that, Chao Yuan secures the gold medal. It‚Äôs been an unforgettable final filled with breathtaking performances. Thank you for joining us for our Olympic coverage.*
