### Map of Optimal Areas for Apple Farming

Developed a suitability map for apple cultivation to assist farmers in selecting optimal locations for starting apple orchards. The map also serves as an indicator of the impacts of global warming and helps in preparing strategies for mitigating potential agricultural losses.

### Hiking routes Map

Designed hiking routes for Jirisan by considering the locations of shelters, KTX stations, and express bus terminals. Utilized QGIS tools to specify new routes and visualize them in 3D, which also aids in emergency situations like rescues and fire incidents.
