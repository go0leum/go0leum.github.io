[github: Construction Resource Management using Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/go0leum/crm_rl_iot.git)

- Collaborator: Junseok Park [peterijr123](https://github.com/peterjr123)

Efficient resource allocation in construction projects plays a critical role in influencing cost, duration, and quality. It is essential to allocate various construction resources based on the needs, timing, location, and availability at each site.

In this project, we aim to define tasks that may arise in construction site projects and find optimal equipment operation process policies through reinforcement learning. This approach is based on the [Simulation of autonomous resource allocation through deep reinforcement learning-based portfolio-project integration.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105381)

## Key Objectives

- Resource Allocation: Assigning construction resources based on the requirements, availability, and timing at each site.

- Task Definition: Defining tasks in construction site projects.

- Reinforcement Learning: Utilizing reinforcement learning to find the optimal policy for resource management.

- Optimization: Conducting reinforcement learning to minimize the time required to complete given projects with limited resources.

Conducted reinforcement learning in a user-specified construction site environment and visualized the learning outcomes through a simulator.

The simulator serves to illustrate the results of reinforcement learning applied in a designated construction site, providing a clear visual representation of the learning outcomes.
