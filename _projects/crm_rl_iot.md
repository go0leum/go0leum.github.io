## üß† Construction Resource Management using Reinforcement Learning

Efficiently allocating construction resources is essential for controlling costs, meeting project deadlines, and maintaining quality. This project proposes a novel approach using **deep reinforcement learning** to determine optimal operational policies for resource deployment across dynamic construction site environments.

---

### üéØ Project Objectives

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Efficiently assign equipment and workforce based on time-sensitive and location-specific requirements.
- **Task Modeling**: Define project tasks with varying priorities and dependencies within the construction process.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Train agents to autonomously learn optimal resource scheduling strategies.
- **Optimization**: Minimize total construction duration and idle time through learned policy execution under limited-resource constraints.

### üß© Approach & Methodology

This work builds upon the framework introduced in  
üìñ *[Simulation of autonomous resource allocation through deep reinforcement learning-based portfolio-project integration](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105381)*,  
adopting **deep Q-learning** and a discrete-event simulation environment to train and evaluate agent behavior across multiple construction sites.
